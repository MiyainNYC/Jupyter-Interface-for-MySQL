    "# MySQL Exercise 5: Summaries of Groups of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you've learned how to select, reformat, manipulate, order, and summarize data from a single table in database.  In this lesson, you are going to learn how to summarize multiple subsets of your data in the same query.  The method for doing this is to include a \"GROUP BY\" clause in your SQL query.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## The GROUP BY clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The GROUP BY clause comes after the WHERE clause, but before ORDER BY or LIMIT:\n",

    "\n",
    "The GROUP BY clause is easy to incorporate into your queries.  In fact, it might be a little too easy to incorporate into MySQL queries, because it can be used incorrectly in MySQL queries even when no error message is displayed.  As a consequence, I suggest you adopt a healthy dose of caution every time you use the GROUP BY clause.  By the end of this lesson, you will understand why.  When used correctly, though, GROUP BY is one of the most useful and efficient parts of an SQL query, and once you are comfortable using it, you will use it very frequently.\n",

    "Let's return to a question from MySQL Exercise 4.  How would you query the average rating for each of the 40 tests in the Reviews table? As we discussed, one very inefficient method to do that would be to write 40 separate queries with each one having a different test name in the WHERE conditional clause.  Then you could copy or transcribe the results from all 40 queries into one place.  But that wouldn't be very pleasant.  Here's how you could do the same thing using one query that has a GROUP BY clause:\n",

    "\n",
    "This query will output the average rating for each test.  More technically, this query will instruct MySQL to average all the rows that have the same value in the test_name column.\n",
    "\n",
